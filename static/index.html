    <p>The goal is to fill the rectangular game field with horizontal and
    vertical lines, such that each line starts and ends "outside" of the
    field. A started line extends in a straight manner until it hits a blocked
    tile or the outside. In the former case, the line must be continued in
    either possible direction.</p>
